  <h4>02-Mar-2025 "Serverless" Postgres: A Developer's Dream with just a Pinch of Reality</h4>

  <p>
    Firebase has been around for 15 years with its <a href=https://firebase.google.com/docs/database>real-time database offering</a>.
    Firebase is owned by Google for 10 years, and they provide <a href=https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore>a more flexible store</a> for nearly as long.
    But despite having plenty of goodies, they only offered a document database.
    The niche of a relational database was vacant. Until Supabase took it.
    Consistency enforcement, formally defined data relations, structured queries make a relational database stand out.
    Firebase tries to catch up with its <a href=https://firebase.google.com/docs/data-connect>data connect</a>.
    There are numerous other products on the serverless relational database market.
  </p>

  <h3>The Problem</h3>

  <p>
    Lately, back-end is perceived as an unavoidable necessity, an API provider for browser and mobile apps, buried down.
    Sometimes, it serves the only purpose - to store and provide data.
  </p>

  <p>
    Back-end thins out, offloading logic to <em>third-party service providers</em>:
    automation (Zapier);
    image resizing, file uploads serving static assets (AWS S3);
    DDoS protection, caching and load balancing (Cloudflare);
    user authentication (Auth0 and WorkOS);
    user management (Okta);
    providing analytical data (Looker);
    full-text search (Algolia);
    pub-sub and real-time data;
    logging;
    transactional and bulk emails, push notifications;
    ... you name it.
    New architectures offer a <em>backend-less approach</em>.
    Well, the back-end and <em>servers are still involved, just not owned or directly managed by us</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Back-end kept holding on to databases, which remained part of the core in every product built.
    Self-hosting databases, be it Redis, Postgres, or any other - scaling it, and keeping it <a href=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/high-availability.html>highly available</a> is hard.
    And it's a <mark>burden, taking the focus away from your business goals</mark>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The missing part in the jigsaw was a relational database managed by a third-party.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not missing anymore.
  </p>

  <h3>The Promise</h3>

  <p>
    <a href=https://supabase.com/>Supabase</a>, a full Postgres database accessible from the front-end via JavaScript API, allowing <a href=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html>row-level security</a> for granular user access to data, authentication, file uploads, real-time streaming, vector storage, message queues, and background job processing sounds just fantastic.
    Yet, it is real.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just imagine the possibilities.
    <em>Adding dynamic features</em> as Medium-like <a href=https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214406358-About-highlights>highlights</a>, <a href=https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214035868-Leave-a-note>contextual notes</a>, comments; Reddit-like ‚Üì‚Üë votes <em>to a static site becomes trivial</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's a whole list of projects <a href=https://www.madewithsupabase.com/>made with Supabase</a>, and it's a small subset of what was done before <a href=https://supabase.com/ga>Supabase went GA</a>.
  </p>

  <blockquote><a href=https://www.producthunt.com/products/supabase#supabase-b37accde-66c0-4c60-bc5c-2634afa7cfe2>more than a third of the current YC are building with Supabase</a></blockquote>

  <p>
    Wow!
    That means something more complicated than just adding comments to a static site can be possible, right?
  </p>

  <h3>Thought experiment</h3>

  <p>
    Can you imagine that you can have a whole bunch of options to sign up users, and let them fetch and save only the data you declared as accessible to them?
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Any user can add a new `article` record</li>
    <li>Only the user can change the text or the title of their article</li>
    <li>Any user can add a comment on any other user's article</li>
    <li>Only the comment author or the article author can remove a comment</li>
    <li>You can vote on articles and comments, but only the ones you're not an author of</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Database backups, scaling, high-availability, underlying "disk" storage, engine version upgrades, connection pooling - are those problems all transparently handled for you.
    <em>Saving big on development</em> and DB maintenance time looks plausible.
    <em>And no more back-end development or maintenance either!</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Isn't this beautiful? ü•π
  </p>

  <p>
    It is worth saying that Supabase is not the only one.
    I've discovered a few alternatives (in the order I've discovered them): <a href=https://www.prisma.io/>Prisma</a> - a battle-tested <a href=https://www.prisma.io/orm>ORM</a> that can be used with Supabase, and <a href=https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-postgres-early-access>recently</a> their own <a href=https://www.prisma.io/postgres>cloud Postgres</a>, still in early access; <a href=https://www.thenile.dev>Nile</a>; <a href=https://neon.tech>Neon</a>; and <a href=https://backendless.com/features/backendless-core/backendless-database>more</a>...
  </p>

  <p>
    How does it work internally? At a glance it's a mix of (realistically-looking pseudocode below):
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      A JS wrapper around a protocol allowing to access <a href=https://docs.postgrest.org>Postgres via HTTP</a>
      <pre>
        db.from('acticles').all()
      </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href=https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-api>authentication</a>
      <pre>
        auth.login('username', 'password')
      </pre>
      or
      <pre>
        auth.social.linkedInOIDC.signIn()
      </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html>row-level security</a> policies
      <pre>
        ALTER TABLE articles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
        CREATE POLICY "Fetch own articles"
          ON "public"."articles"
          TO authenticated
          USING ( current_user_id = author_id );
      </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-with.html>Common Table Expressions</a>
      <pre>
        WITH auth AS (
          SELECT uid AS current_user_id FROM auth.sessions WHERE session_id = 'foo-bar-baz'
        )
          SELECT * FROM articles;
      </pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    By stacking this together, you get a Postgres database that can be accessed via a JS API, and provide row-level granular access for users.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've built <a href=https://exclusively.pro/>a project</a> backed by Supabase. Did it work the way it's promised, the way I imagined it to work? The reality of <a href=/serverless-postgres-bitter-reality.html>turned out to be completely different</a>...
