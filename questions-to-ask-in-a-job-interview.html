  <h4>26-Apr-2020 Questions to Ask in a Job Interview</h4>

  Company's engineering blog reveals challenges and openness to share best practices. Company's GitHub account shows quality standards.

  That's all I know before an interview. But the question "do you want to know something about the company" during an interview puzzles me.

  The questions below unveil distinctive factors that may affect your choice whether to proceed with them or not.

  Why? Answers to those questions come to you sooner or later when you join a company. And often you're unable to change or handle that truth. Those questions can reveal the factors that make your job a breeze, or a nightmare. Knowing the answers helps you make a serious decision with more certainty.

  Since I wrote those questions down, I' using asking them during interviews. You are free to use them just as well. Even if you don't understand the importance of the answers, you'll look smart and interested.

  If the salary motivates you most, those questions are NOT for you. But does it?

  I wrote those questions from a Ruby developer standpoint. Languages don't play such a big role these days, but YMMV (your milage may vary). Operational, administrative, organizational and architectural questions still apply for companies using other platforms.

  Those questions are dry: make sure you understand why to ask the question and pros and cons of possible answers.

  Psychological tests ask the same questions in different ways to detect deviation in the answers. The questions below have similar interlinked traps that may reveal the real state of affairs.

  An interviewee's question time has limits, make sure that the interviewer knows in advance that you have a fair amount of questions.

  Ask what matters most to you.

  These questions compliment and update the <a href=https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/>Joel Test</a> and <a href=https://myers.io/2017/04/04/the-joel-test-for-2017/>Joel Test for 2017</a>.
