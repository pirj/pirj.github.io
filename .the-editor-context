I am a software developer writing about different aspect of software, software architecture, software development practices, and software products.

I write mostly for myself, but share my thoughts and experiences with occasional readers in an informal, conversational style, yet professional style.

My aim is to engage and educate fellow professionals and entrepreneurs who are interested in similar topics.
