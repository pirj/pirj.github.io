  <h4>03-Jun-2019 One-line Procfile manager</h4>

  A <a href=http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/#PROCFILE>Procfile</a> contains pairs of process names and commands used to run it. It is often used to run several processes locally, during development, typically a web server, asset server, and background job processor:

<pre>
  web: bundle exec rails server
  assets: yarn serve
  jobs: bundle exec sidekiq
</pre>

  There is a number of inherent problems with <a href=https://github.com/ddollar/foreman>Foreman</a>:
    - the output of all processes is interleaved. It's near impossible to understand what printed what.
    - using REPL when stopping at a debug breakpoint splits your input evenly across the processes, making it barely usable.
    - selective process restart is impossible.
    - selective filtering or focusing of process output is impossible.

  There are tools out there, specifically <a href=https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind>overmind</a>. It runs processes in <a href=https://github.com/tmux/tmux>tmux</a>, and that resolves the problems Forman has.
  However Overmind is an additional tool that you need to learn.

  That led me to a thought that this can be done in a simpler way, running the processes in tmux's split panes.

  And a single'ish-line <a href=https://github.com/pirj/toreman>Toreman</a> was born that does exactly that.
  Well, initially it was actually single line, but I decided to format it for better readability.

  Moving between the panes with &lt;Prefix&gt; h/j/k/l can be configured with:

<pre>
  # ~/.tmux.conf
  bind h select-pane -L
  bind j select-pane -D
  bind k select-pane -U
  bind l select-pane -R
</pre>

  Or you can employ a tmux <a href=https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-pain-control/blob/master/pain_control.tmux#L19>pain control plugin</a>.

  Zooming a pane has a standard convenient key binding, &lt;Prefix&gt;+z.

  Killing a process is simple as ^C, pausing it - ^Z.

  I'm not an expert in the field, and writing shell script feels like solving a puzzle, but it's usually very rewarding.
  Full annotated Toreman source below:

<pre class=shell>
  grep --invert-match '^#' &lt; Procfile |                       # Filter out comments
    sed -e 's/^[^:]*: //' |                                   # Split into process name/command pairs
    xargs -I {} \                                             # For each pair:
      tmux \                                                  #
        split-window -v \; \                                  # - split window
        send-keys '[ -s .env ] &amp;&amp; source .env; {}' 'C-m' &amp;&amp;   # - type the command, prefixed with a `source .env;`
    tmux \                                                    #
      select-pane -t 1 \; \                                   # Switch to initial pane
      send-keys 'C-d' \; \                                    # - and close it
      select-layout ${1:-tiled}                               # Also, select the layout, defaulting to tiled
</pre>

  Please do not paste the code above, shell script <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9522631/how-to-put-a-line-comment-for-a-multi-line-command>won't work with comments inserted like this</a>.

  Toreman supports loading the <a href=http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/#ENVIRONMENT>.env file</a>, to load the default environment variables for processes.
  Typical .env file looks like this:

<pre>
  RAILS_ENV=development
  SKIP_BULLET=true
</pre>

  Toreman accepts a single argument, a layout to be used. Tiled is the default, the other options are even-horizontal, even-vertical, main-horizontal, and main-vertical.

  As per the comments, Toreman might not support alternative shells (e.g. tcsh, ksh) so well.
  I've tested on Fish shell, it worked quite fine except that you have to prefix environment variables with an <code>env</code>, e.g.:

<pre>
  web: env PORT=8080 bundle exec rails server
</pre>

  If you're on macOS and are using Homebrew, installing Toreman is easy as:

<pre class=shell>
  brew install pirj/homebrew-toreman/toreman
</pre>
